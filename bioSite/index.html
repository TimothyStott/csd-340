                        since. Ever since he can remember Kyle has considered this home.

                        Kyle is restoring a 1953 Willys CJ that he received from his grandfather. The Jeep was a farm
                        vehicle used for the last 50 years on his grandparents farm. The past two years have seen a lot
                        of restoration.
