            <h1>A little About Kyle</h1>
            <p>Kyle John Mohr, better known to his closest friends as Kevin, calls Eau Claire, Wisconsin home even
                though he was born in Two Rivers on July 25th, 1991. He considers his family a major influence on his
                entire life and plans on finally settling down there once he is done. However, he is far from done
                working, travelling, and learning. Currently he is in school to become for his private pilotâ€™s license
                in Utah. Kyle loves the outdoors, hiking, lifting weights, and kayaking. Even though he has travelled
                all over the world he would consider Alaska his favorite destination. He once spent an extended period
                there hunting, fishing, and hiking directly off a boat on Prince William Sound. Kyle would never
                consider himself a sports lover, but he does enjoy drag racing and dirt track racing when they are in
                season, and he can attend. Kyle is also extremely passionate about public land use causes. He feels very
                strongly that the government should open lands to public use and that there should be more programs in
                place for partnerships with private landowners to also open their land up for public use. Kyle feels
                strongly that the combination of these two things could help further wildlife habitat conservation and
                allow more individuals to access the outdoors and experience it the way he does and hopefully also fall
                in love with it as well. Kyle is a lover of the outdoors and animals, but unfortunately due to his
                current circumstances (being in school away from family) he currently has no pets, but he would like you
                to know that if he could have a pet he would have an American Bulldog and the only name he could ever
                give him is Chuck. </p>
