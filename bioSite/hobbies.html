                The Life of Kyle
                <p class="hobbies-text">
                    Kyle loves to fly, but since it's expensive and he isn't fully a pilot yet he spends a lot of his
                    time lifting weights, hunting, and sport shooting. Working out has become a passion for him for a
                    few different reasons: it keeps him healthy and physicaly in shape, it is great for mental health,
                    and it's a great way to pass the time between studying for flight exams and actually behing in
                    class. One of Kyle's favorite pastimes is hunting. His grandfather and father taught him to hunt and
                    intially they hunted public lands. Which has led him to be a large advocate for opening public lands
                    to hunting for everyone to experience and enjoy.
