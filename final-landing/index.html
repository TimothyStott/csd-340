            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                Tim has many hobbies that he enjoys. With working full time, he does not always have time to spend on
                them; however, he always makes sure to hit the gym. He finds it to be the most
                important of his hobbies since it helps keep him in good physical shape and keep his mind
                sharp. When he has extra downtime, he really enjoys playing video games and finding new breweries to
                explore with his wife, Natalie.

            <h2>Expertise</h2>
            <p>
                Tim spent 8 years in the Marine Corps as an Aviation Ordnance Technician. He spent most of his time
                working on weapons systems for the H-1 helicopter platform and working on crew served weapons like
                the 50 caliber machine gun and the M240. He currently works at a company that builds CNC routers, where
                he has recently moved to a full time software support role with the CAD/CAM software options they
                provide. In the future, he genuinely hopes to be in a software development role either with web or
                desktop application development and currently he has no preference.
